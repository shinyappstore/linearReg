# linearReg: Perform Statistical Linear Regression

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/linearReg](https://shinyappstore.com/a/linearReg)__

linearReg, an essential component of the MEPHAS suite, is designed for performing linear regression on diverse datasets. Linear regression is a statistical analysis method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In the case of one explanatory variable, it is referred to as simple linear regression, while more than one explanatory variable involves multiple linear regression. MEPHAS, an open-source and free web-interactive platform, serves the analytical needs of researchers. With linearReg, users can calculate basic descriptive statistics, draw plots of variables on datasets. The application facilitates the building of simple or multiple linear regression models, obtaining regression estimates, and predicting new data based on the regression analysis. LinearReg empowers researchers with efficient and user-friendly tools for robust statistical analyses.original publication: BMC Bioinformatics. 2020 May 11;21(1):183.
